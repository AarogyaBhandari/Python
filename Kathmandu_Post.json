        "content": "Riding on a strong anti-incumbency slogan, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), formed barely five months before the November 2022 House of Representatives election, emerged as the fourth-largest force in the 275-member House of Representatives.\nThe party then secured seven seats under the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system and 13 under proportional representation, for a total of 20 seats. Three months after the election, the Supreme Court annulled party chair Rabi Lamichhane\u2019s lawmaker status after the citizenship certificate he produced to contest the election was found to be invalid.\nWhile he retained his seat from Chitwan-2 in the April 2023 by-election, the party also managed to add one seat, registering a win in Tanahun-1. Former National Planning Commission vice-chair Swarnim Wagle won the seat vacated by Ramchandra Paudel after being elected as President.\nThe bypolls extended its strength to 21 in the House. Of these, eight were FPTP seats. Notably, most of these candidates made their ways into Parliament from the constituencies that had traditionally been communist strongholds.\nSix of the eight seats came from constituencies that were known to be communist bastions. Until the September Gen Z movement, RSP leaders often complained that they were cutting into the communist vote bank, and the Nepali Congress was unnecessarily suspicious of them.\nIn the changed political landscape following the September movement that ousted the Congress-UML coalition government, the Lamichhane-led party is again in the limelight after inducting former Kathmandu Metropolitan City mayorBalendra Shah, popularly known as Balen, and his team in the run-up to the March 5 election. Shah, who is the party\u2019s prime ministerial face, is already in a full election campaign mode, from the country\u2019s east to the far west.\nWill the rise in the party\u2019s popularity after Shah\u2019s entry help RSP expand beyond the communist strongholds into constituencies long dominated by the Congress?\nBiraj Bhakta Shrestha, an RSP leader, says his party did well in the communist strongholds in the last election \u201cas the communist government formed after the 2017 election failed to deliver on its promises\u201d. The two largest communist parties of the time, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), entered into an alliance for the 2017 election and later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP).\nBut the NCP government failed to live up to its promises despite an excellent performance in the election, which was contested on the agenda of stability, delivery, and good governance. The subsequent internal feud led to its split and the revival of the original parties\u2014the UML and the Maoist Centre.\nThe Congress emerged as the largest party in the 2022 periodic elections, followed by the UML, while the Maoist Centre ended up in a distant third place. A powerful Congress-UML coalition was governing the country when the Gen Z movement happened.\n\u201cThe two-day Gen Z revolt against corruption, and for good governance and transparency toppled the Congress-UML government, which symbolised a regressive force,\u201d said Shrestha. \u201cAs our party was formed by championing these agendas, and as the party that embraces the spirit of the Gen Z movement, we expect to cash in during the elections, allowing us to expand even into Congress strongholds.\u201d\nNot everyone agrees. Those with sound knowledge of the Congress claim it will retain its traditional support while also getting the support of new voters.\n\u201cWith the change in the Congress guard, the party will do well in the elections,\u201d Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, argues. \u201cBesides, the RSP\u2019s electoral campaigns continue to focus on UML-dominated constituencies, so it will have less impact on the Congress.\u201d\nGagan Kumar Thapa has been elected the new Congress president from a special general convention and has been projected as the party\u2019s prime ministerial candidate. In Wagle\u2019s view, the drastic yet largely unexpected move has rejuvenated the Congress rank and file.\nBhim Bhurtel, a left-leaning political analyst, says something similar, though he frames it differently.\nCadres who are loyal to another party are unlikely to vote for the RSP but swing voters who chose the UML could opt for the RSP, he said. \u201cAlso, voters aged 45 and above who voted for the RSP in the last election may not vote for them this time,\u201d he said.\nIn the previous election, RSP won Kathmandu-2, Kathmandu-7, Lalitpur-3, Chitwan-1, and Chitwan-2, which are widely regarded as traditional strongholds of the communist parties, according to electoral data. Similarly, Kathmandu-6, another seat secured by the party, has been regarded as a partial communist bastion. Only two constituencies\u2014Kathmandu-8 and Tanahun-1\u2014that went to the RSP were seen as traditional Congress strongholds.\nIn Lalitpur-3, RSP\u2019s Toshima Karki won in 2022. Pampha Bhusal, then a Maoist leader, had won in 2008 and 2017 from this constituency. Before that, Raghuji Panta, who is currently a vice-chair of the UML, had won the 1994 mid-term election from the same place.",

        "tag": "National",
        "content": "In Nepal\u2019s fast-changing political landscape, the march towards inclusive democracy has taken a historic turn. For decades, sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities, despite constitutional recognition, have largely stayed on the periphery of formal politics.\nThis election cycle, however, marks a shift, as a significant number of candidates are contesting the March 5 elections through the newly formed Samabesi Samajbadi Party (SSP), Pragatisheel Loktrantik Party (PLP), and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). A total of 20 candidates are in the fray across the three parties under the proportional representation and first-past-the-post systems combined.\nTheir entry challenges a longstanding pattern of political exclusion and raises a question about how inclusive Nepal\u2019s democratic system truly is, according to the rights activist.\nThe SSP, a recently registered political party that brings together sexual and gender minorities alongside other marginalised communities, is at the centre of this shift. Years of being sidelined by the established political forces led them to form their own party.\n\u201cWe landed in the political battlefield as big parties have failed to address the issues of the marginalised. We want to reach Parliament to speak from our own lived experiences,\u201d Numa Limbu (Chanchala), the party\u2019s chairperson, who is a third-gender woman.\nThe party has fielded 15 candidates under the proportional representation system and six candidates under the first-past-the-post system. Limbu herself is contesting from Morang.\nOther direct candidates include Pinky Rai from Okhaldhunga-1; Surendra Pandey from Kathmandu-1; Purnachand Paudel from Kathmandu-10; Binod Lama (Konika) from Kavrepalanchok-1; and Devendra Bahadur Khatri (Madhu) from Rupandehi-2.\nPinky Rai, a third gender woman, described the moment as historic. \u2018\u2018Everywhere there is opportunity and quota for all: women and men, Dalits, indigenous groups, but we have never had such opportunities\u2014whether in governmental or non-governmental sectors,\u2019\u2019 she said.\nDespite this, we kept seeking our rights. \u2018\u2018As a result, today, we have succeeded in making history in Nepali politics.\u2019\u2019\nThe party\u2019s political philosophy centres on participatory democracy within a federal system, with an emphasis on decentralising decision-making. \u201cWe want voices to be heard at the local level, not just Singha Durbar,\u201d Limbu said.\nShe also emphasised that representation matters in practice. \u201cWe understand the issues of women, men, youth, Dalits and people with disabilities because we are part of those groups. If we are in decision-making positions, we won\u2019t need to be \u2018requested\u2019 to raise these issues.\u201d\n\u2018\u2018The party also proposes collateral-free loans for youth who want to be entrepreneurs,\u201d she said.\nSGM political participation in this election is not limited to one party. Rukshana Kapali, a transgender female human rights candidate of the Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party, represents another strand of this emerging trend.\nAfter years of judicial activism, Kapali said she concluded that rights secured through courts and non-governmental organisationslobbying alone were insufficient. \u201cMarginalised groups are often forced to request rights from officials who do not understand them,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, there is almost no debate on these issues in Parliament.\u201d\nKapali advocates for a specific constitutional article dedicated to sexual and gender minorities, similar to provisions for women and Dalits. She also seeks a comprehensive review of discriminatory laws and new legislation addressing trans identity.\nBeyond SGM rights, Kapali\u2019s agenda includes multilingualism and indigenous rights. She has proposed a federal language Act to ensure minority languages are recognised at the local level and integrated into education and employment.",

        "title": "Tanahun-1 heads to polls with a history of changing choices",
        "tag": "Politics",
        "content": "A look back at the electoral history of Tanahun constituency 1 shows a striking pattern\u2014voters here rarely repeat their choices. Since the 1991 general elections, eight parliamentary elections have been held in the constituency and the voters have consistently elected new faces from different parties except in the mid-term poll in 1994 and general election in 1999.\nThat reputation for unpredictability is looming as Tanahun-1 gears up for another election, with residents weighing frustration with old parties against disappointment with newer political forces.\nIn the 2022 general election, people elected Nepali Congress candidate Ramchandra Paudel, the current President of the country, from Tanahun-1. Paudel, a native of Byas Municipality-33 in the same constituency, vacated the seat after assuming the presidency. In the April 2023 by-election the voters overwhelmingly backed Swarnim Wagle of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), sending him to the House of Representatives with a landslide margin that stunned the traditional parties.\nNow, less than three years on, Wagle, 51, is again contesting from Tanahun-1 in the upcoming election scheduled for March 5. Sixteen candidates are in the fray, including Nepali Congress\u2019 Govinda Bhattarai, aged 62; CPN-UML candidate Bhagwati Neupane, 49; Nepali Communist Party candidate Bidyanath Dhakal, 65; and independent contender Dipak Raj Joshi, 56. Locals say the established parties are struggling to defend their legacies, while Wagle faces the challenge of retaining the credibility he built during the by-election.\nConstituency 1 of Tanahun, a hill district of Gandaki province, has not produced the same parliamentarian twice since 1991, except during the 1994 and 1999 elections when Nepali Congress leader Govinda Raj Joshi won three consecutive parliamentary elections. Then CPN (Maoist) leader Suresh Ale Magar emerged victorious in 2008 Constituent Assembly (CA) elections while Congress\u2019s Shankar Bhandari won in the second CA elections held in 2013. In 2017, UML candidate Krishna Kumar Shrestha defeated Paudel under the then left alliance.\nPaudel\u2019s political stature looms large over the constituency. A six-time lawmaker, five-time minister and former Speaker, he became Congress parliamentary party leader in 2008 and the country\u2019s President in February 2023. His long career, marked by repeated arrests during the democratic movement and years in prison, has given the Congress a deep emotional connection in Tanahun. Yet locals say that legacy alone no longer guarantees votes. \u201cCongress once dominated here, but since 2008 it has alternated between victory and defeat,\u201d said a local party worker in Byas.\nIn the 2022 elections, Paudel obtained 25,361 votes, defeating UML\u2019s Ek Bahadur Rana Magar, who polled 19,981. Independent Govinda Raj Joshi, rebelling against the Congress, received 6,886 votes, while RSP\u2019s Bikash Sigdel garnered 6,044. The April 2023 by-election, however, completely overturned the picture. Wagle won with 34,919 votes, defeating Congress candidate Bhattarai by nearly 15,000 votes. UML-backed former police chief Sarbendra Khanal finished a distant third.\nMany locals attribute Wagle\u2019s victory to widespread voter disillusionment with the Congress, UML and the Maoists, as well as quiet support from the Joshi faction. Yet disappointment has grown since then. \u201cPeople voted for change, but after winning, Wagle did not return enough,\u201d said Ram Krishna Bishwakarma, who runs an eatery in Bandipur. \u201cNow there is a feeling that he too turned out like the others.\u201d\nThe political equation has shifted again. The former Maoists who are now under the Nepali Communist Party, are contesting independently, fielding Dhakal, a leftist leader from Bhanu Municipality. UML has nominated Neupane, a former federal affairs minister who is also from Bhanu Municipality, while Congress has again picked Bhattarai, considered well-connected at the local level. Joshi\u2019s son Dipak Raj is running as an independent, drawing on an estimated 5,000 votes loyal to the Joshi camp.\nRSP leader Wagle, a former vice-chairman of the National Planning Commission and foreign-educated economist, insists that national momentum is on the RSP\u2019s side. \u201cI have just begun meeting voters. There is a positive atmosphere for the RSP at the national level, and the people of Tanahun are also very hopeful about us,\u201d he said. \u201cI am enthusiastic. The number of votes may vary slightly compared to last time, but the situation is not challenging.\u201d He added that he plans to carry out election campaigning in all 42 wards of the constituency.\nAcknowledging complaints about his failure to visit his constituencies, he promised to visit all 42 wards during the election campaign. \u201cPeople want good governance, roads, drinking water, education and health services. We can deliver,\u201d he said, pledging to focus on domestic employment so youths are not forced abroad.\nVoters in the constituency appear largely dissatisfied with their elected representatives, from President Paudel to Wagle. Local residents say their frustration with leaders elected from the Congress, the UML and the Maoists pushed them to vote for the RSP candidate, but they now complain that Wagle did not return to the constituency after winning and failed to adequately address local concerns.\nSupporters of Wagle, however, argue that he has been a member of Parliament for barely two years and therefore did not have sufficient time to deliver tangible results. They claim that if re-elected, Wagle would serve as finance minister in a future government led by RSP leader Balen Shah and contribute significantly to the district\u2019s development.\nAt the grassroots, uncertainty dominates. Chandrika BK, a women\u2019s group leader from Dharapani in Bandipur, said she remains undecided. \u201cWe voted for the Congress, UML, Maoists and even the RSP. Nothing really changed,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no work in the village, prices are rising, youths are going abroad. Leaders talk big, but no one delivers.\u201d\nSimilar sentiments were echoed by Bhunti Maya Magar, 72, who complained that beyond old-age allowances, elected leaders had done little. \u201cThey promised drinking water, but taps were built without water. I don\u2019t know whom to trust anymore,\u201d she said.\nOpposition candidates label Wagle a \u201ctourist candidate\u201d from neighbouring Gorkha who failed to address local concerns. But RSP supporters counter that the party has rapidly expanded its organisation, unsettling older parties. \u201cEarlier only Congress, UML and Maoists were active here. Now the RSP has a strong presence,\u201d said Khadga Bahadur Thapa, a homestay operator in Ramkot.\nTanahun-1 includes Devghat, Anbukhaireni and Bandipur rural municipalities, Bhanu Municipality and wards 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Byas Municipality, with 136,882 registered voters. Traditional parties still maintain networks in all wards, but RSP claims organisational reach across the constituency.\nFor many voters, basic services matter more than party labels. Binod Gandharva, a 30-year-old sarangi maker from Bhanu, said people want hospitals, affordable education, jobs and drinking water. \u201cThere is no good hospital. We have to go to Pokhara or Kathmandu for treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need leaders who understand this urgency.\u201d\nCongress candidate Bhattarai believes voter sentiment has swung back. \u201cMany now feel the experiment failed,\u201d he said, claiming alliances would help Congress reclaim the constituency. UML\u2019s Neupane, meanwhile, said her roots in Tanahun and experience in lawmaking would win voters\u2019 trust.\nAs campaigning intensifies, Tanahun-1 once again reflects Nepal\u2019s wider political churn. From Paudel to Wagle, voters here have repeatedly signalled impatience with unmet promises.",

        "tag": "Health",
        "content": "Officials at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services are scrambling to secure vaccine doses following a measles outbreak in the Malangawa Municipality of Sarlahi district.\nPast experience shows that after an outbreak in one area, new outbreaks can occur anywhere at any time. Officials are concerned that the government has no doses in stock for a mass vaccination response.\nThe measles outbreak in Nepalgunj in 2022 spread to 23 districts nationwide, including in the Capital, Kathmandu. Experts say the risk of viral spillover to other areas is high due to heavy public movement to and from disease-hit Malangawa and the March 5 parliamentary elections.\n\u201cWe do not have vaccine doses in stock for a mass vaccination campaign, which is required if an outbreak occurs,\u201d said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. \u201cWe have alerted our development partners about the risk and have also requested vaccine doses in case of new outbreaks.\u201d\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted through fluids from the nose, mouth or throat of an infected person. It can be potentially deadly for unvaccinated people.\nAt least seven children tested positive, and 16 others were hospitalised with measles in the first week of January. The outbreak occurred in the Muslim community in ward 3 of the municipality. The 16 lab-unconfirmed cases are epi-linked (linked to a confirmed case) measles cases, according to officials. Several new suspected cases have been reported from disease-hit areas, according to the Health Ministry.\nThe disease can be prevented with a two-dose vaccine, administered to babies at the age of 9 months and 15 months. The government provides measles vaccines free of charge from health facilities across the country.\nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to vaccinate all children aged 6 months to 14 years in the Malangawa Municipality to reduce the risk of further spread. It has requested the Measles & Rubella Partnership, a global alliance of major international organisations working to eliminate measles and rubella, for vaccine doses.\n\u201cWe will vaccinate all eligible children of the municipality once we receive the doses from aid agencies,\u201d said Gautam \u201cWe have also alerted relevant agencies about the risk of new outbreaks in other areas and stepped up surveillance measures.\u201d\nNepal had aimed to eliminate measles by 2026, as there had been no outbreak since June 2023. However, the outbreak of the contagious virus in Malangawa hindered the country\u2019s progress towards meeting the goal.\nThe country earlier missed the 2019 and 2023 deadlines. A massive measles outbreak occurred in 2022 and 2023.\nMeanwhile, Health Ministry officials say the ongoing vaccination campaign will be completed within the next couple of days as around 70 percent of the targeted children have already been inoculated. The ministry aimed to administer a measles vaccine dose to around 8,000 children under 15 years of age.\nChild health experts say the outbreak in Muslim communities in Sarlahi points to gaps in Nepal\u2019s vaccination coverage.\nThey say that the outbreak has also hindered Nepal\u2019s aim to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets, as more outbreaks could occur in the coming days.\nThe SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the targets.\nTo declare measles eliminated, the number of cases should be fewer than five per 1,000,000 people per year. The country must verify progress through foreign, independent verification. For independent verification, there should be no new outbreak for three consecutive years, officials say.\nDoctors say people of all age groups are vulnerable to measles. Underage children, pregnant women, elderly people and those with weak immunity, such as HIV-infected people, are particularly susceptible.\nEarly symptoms, which usually appear 10-12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes and white, tiny spots inside the mouth. Several days later, rashes develop on the face, upper neck and other parts of the body.\nSome people may suffer from severe complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis, and these diseases may also lead to death.\nChild health experts say a low vaccination coverage, floating populations, lack of public awareness of the importance of vaccines and apathy of government agencies for plugging the loopholes are some reasons behind the regular outbreaks of measles in various parts of the country.\nMeasles was endemic in Nepal, and an average of 90,000 cases were recorded every year from 1994 to 2004. Routine measles vaccination began in the country in 1979, starting with three districts. The campaign was made nationwide after 10 years.",

        "tag": "Money",
        "content": "India\u2019s free trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union, concluded on Tuesday in New Delhi, could pose additional challenges for Nepal\u2014particularly as the nation prepares to graduate from its least developed country (LDC) status\u2014according to the Garment Association of Nepal.\nFTA is an agreement between countries or regional blocs to reduce or eliminate trade barriers through mutual negotiations with the aim of boosting trade.\nSpeaking at a policy dialogue titled\u201cApparel Export: Competitiveness, Critical Challenges and the Way Forward\u201d, organised by the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in Kathmandu on Wednesday, the association said the India-EU deal could further trim Nepal\u2019s ready-made garment exports to European markets, which have already been on a declining trend.\nThe India\u2013EU FTA\u2014described as the \u201cmother of all deals\u201d\u2014was concluded on January 27 after years of negotiations aimed at substantially lowering tariffs on goods and services traded between India and the EU.\nAccording to media reports, the European Commission will eliminate tariffs on most exports of chemicals, machinery and electrical equipment, as well as aircraft and spacecraft, following phased reductions. Duties on motor vehicles\u2014currently as high as 110 percent\u2014will be slashed to 10 percent under a quota of 250,000 vehicles, a volume six times the 37,000-unit quota India granted the United Kingdom under a deal signed last July.\nIndia will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil from the EU. Brussels said the agreement would support investment flows, improve access to European markets and deepen supply-chain integration.\nNew Delhi said nearly all of its exports would receive \u201cpreferential access\u201d to the EU, with textiles, leather, marine products, handicrafts, gems and jewellery set to see reduced or eliminated tariffs. While commodities such as tea, coffee, spices and processed foods are expected to benefit, India has \u201cprudently safeguarded sensitive sectors, including dairy, cereals, poultry, soy meal, and certain fruits and vegetables, balancing export growth with domestic priorities,\u201d the report said.\n\u201cIndia\u2019s FTA with the EU could pose additional challenges for Nepal, particularly in the context of the country\u2019s impending graduation from LDC status,\u201d said Pashupati Dev Pandey, president of the Garment Association of Nepal.\n\u201cEven before the FTA, trade between India and European countries was already huge. With the agreement in place, it will increase exponentially, making it difficult for Nepali ready-made garments to compete in those markets,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the association, Nepal currently exports nearly Rs6 billion worth of ready-made garments annually to European countries, a figure expected to decline in the coming years.\nWith the FTA, India\u2019s trade with the EU is likely to surge, market observers in Nepal said. Nepal, they added, could request the EU to continue providing trade facilities currently available to LDCs even after graduation in November this year. Given the anticipated rise in demand for Indian goods, Nepal could also seek India\u2019s support in supplying and processing plant-based fibres such as allo (stinging nettle), banana and bamboo.\nThe ready-made garment industry urged the government to prioritise the garment and apparel sector, stressing the need for close coordination among labour groups, producers and policymakers.\nRabi Shanker Sainju, vice-chair of SAWTEE, said trade negotiations are a continuous process rather than a one-off event. Referring to the India\u2013EU FTA, he noted that while such agreements result from long and structured negotiations, Nepal still lacks even a standard operating procedure for conducting FTAs.\nAccording to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, Nepal exported ready-made garments worth Rs8.75 billion in the last fiscal year.\nPrakash Sharma, national project coordinator of the LDC Graduation Project at the International Labour Organisation Nepal, said the garment and textile sector is expected to be among the hardest hit by LDC graduation, including through potential job losses.\n\u201cThe United Nations\u2019 assessment of Nepal\u2019s LDC graduation readiness has revealed significant apprehension within the private sector. While deferral remains an option, it would require consideration of the perspectives of key partners such as the EU and the United States,\u201d Sharma said, according to a statement issued by SAWTEE. He also highlighted Nepal\u2019s lack of a clear strategy to utilise a deferral, if granted.\nParas Kharel, executive director of SAWTEE, said that if critical constraints are addressed, firms expect exports to increase by an average of 87.4 percent compared to a business-as-usual scenario. He suggested exploring alternative markets through more effective use of existing trade agreements, negotiating new trade arrangements and economic partnership agreements, and strengthening economic diplomacy.",

        "tag": "Culture & Lifestyle",
        "content": "Bridging the gap between traditional music and modern rhythms, Sonagi Blues stands out as a prominent inspiration of how music can envelop introspection, philosophy and lived experience.\nWhat began as a trio for an Ethnomusicology project at Kathmandu University has evolved into aband of five members, Appeal Paudel, Aayush Thapa, Shreejal Sayanju, Nischal Rai and Prashant Shakya, shaped by the collectivedhunsof sarod, guitar, nagara, bass and vocals.\nRiju Tuladhar, the band\u2019s ensemble teacher at the University, pushed their aspirations beyond their classroom. Tuladhar guided the band towards a deeper understanding of Nepal\u2019s traditional musical landscape, encouraging them to explore and to create.\nAs they sharpened their instrumental skills through everyday practice, the Ethnomusicology course eventually took on a deeper meaning in their lives beyond academics. Comfort nurtured their creativity, forming a collective and constructive space, less as band members and more as brothers. \u201cIf the band were formed based on rigid contracts, we would not have as good a drift as we do today,\u201d says Sayanju.\nAdding vibrancy to college life, the band explored collaborative creations with a shared passion for music. The band\u2019s name, initially brainstormed as SWA-NI-GA, a Newa name for the Kathmandu Valley, is now known as SO-NA-GI. So- for Sarod, Na- for Nagara and Gi- for guitar. Redefining the essence of \u2018Blues\u2019 in their music, the band recalled their memories of companionship, growth and self-discovery as students.\nThey smiled when asked about their family\u2019s reaction to their musical journey. Perhaps, this reminded them of their earlier days, how important their passion was to them, and equally, their family\u2019s support. \u201cSustenance was the primary question,\u201d says Sayanju. \u201cWhen we started making music weekly as Sonagi Blues, financial legitimacy was guaranteed to an extent. Finally, my family agreed that I was doing something productive.\u201d\nUncertainties served as a medium of electing a common drive for the band, rather than a threat. They navigated their way one step at a time, visualising their aim as a collective effort. Their third-year Ensemble class highlighted reasons to make music. \u201cOne of our greatest inspirations was when our professor Riju Tuladhar asked us to outline what was not there in the musical scene of Nepal,\u201d says Sayanju.\n\u201cWe started tracing through the wide array of the musical ecosystem, expressing our preferences better. This helped us push ourselves from the idea of being just another artist in Nepal,\u201d he adds. Eventually, new ideas started to emerge from a common ground, oozing an identity that defines the band today.",
